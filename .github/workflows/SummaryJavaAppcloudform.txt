Let's break this down into simple, manageable steps. You're trying to get your Java application, which you've already written, running on the cloud using AWS. You'll need to create a JAR file first, and then you'll use AWS CloudFormation to set up the necessary infrastructure to host it. Think of CloudFormation as a blueprint for your cloud resources.

Creating a JAR File from Your Java Code üß±
A JAR file (Java Archive) is a package that contains all the compiled code and resources for your Java application. You can create a JAR file directly from your command line. Here's how:

Compile your code: Open your command line and navigate to the directory where your HelloApp.java file is saved. Use the following command to compile it:

javac HelloApp.java

This command will create a HelloApp.class file.

Create the JAR file: Now, use the jar command to bundle your compiled code into a JAR file. The -c flag means "create," the -v flag means "verbose" (shows you what it's doing), and the -f flag means "file." The -e flag stands for "entry point" and tells Java which class has the main method to start your application.

jar -cvfe HelloApp.jar HelloApp HelloApp.class

This will create a file named HelloApp.jar.

Hosting Your JAR File with AWS CloudFormation üöÄ
CloudFormation is a service that lets you define your cloud resources in a template (a file) and then creates and manages those resources for you. Instead of manually creating an EC2 instance, setting up networking, and installing Java, you write a template that tells CloudFormation to do all of this automatically.

Here are the high-level steps to use CloudFormation for your application:

Upload your JAR file: You need a place for CloudFormation to get your JAR file. The easiest way is to upload it to an Amazon S3 bucket. S3 is a storage service, like Google Drive, for the cloud.

Go to the AWS Management Console, search for S3, and create a new bucket.

Upload your HelloApp.jar file to this bucket.

Create the CloudFormation Template: The template is a text file, usually in YAML or JSON format, that describes the resources you need. For your application, you'll need at least two things:

An EC2 instance: This is a virtual server where your application will run. You'll need to specify what kind of server it is and what operating system it uses.

User Data: This is a script that the EC2 instance runs when it first starts up. You'll use this script to install Java, download your JAR file from S3, and run your application.

Here's a simplified example of what your CloudFormation.yaml template might look like.

YAML

Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro # A small, cheap server
      ImageId: ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0 # An Amazon Linux 2 AMI
      UserData:
        Fn::Base64:
          !Sub |
            #!/bin/bash
            yum update -y
            yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y # Install Java
            aws s3 cp s3://your-s3-bucket-name/HelloApp.jar /home/ec2-user/HelloApp.jar # Download your JAR file
            java -jar /home/ec2-user/HelloApp.jar & # Run your application in the background
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: MyJavaAppInstance
      SecurityGroups: # This needs to be a reference to a Security Group allowing traffic on port 8080
        - !Ref MySecurityGroup

  MySecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Enable HTTP access on port 8080
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 8080
          ToPort: 8080
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
Note: Replace your-s3-bucket-name with the actual name of your S3 bucket.

Deploy with CloudFormation:

Go to the AWS Management Console, search for CloudFormation.

Click "Create stack" and select "With new resources."

Choose "Upload a template file" and upload your CloudFormation.yaml.

Follow the wizard, giving your stack a name and reviewing the details.

Click "Create stack." CloudFormation will now read your template, create the EC2 instance, security group, and run the startup script to get your application up and running. This process can take a few minutes.

Verify your application: Once the stack is complete, go to the EC2 service in the AWS console, find the instance that was created, and copy its public IP address. Paste this IP address into your browser, followed by :8080 (e.g., http://54.123.45.67:8080). You should see the "Hello from EC2!" message.


error: Class names, 'HelloJava', are only accepted if annotation processing is explicitly requested

1 error



What does this mean?



This error message is from the Java compiler (javac). It means that you've tried to compile a file that has a different name from the public class it contains.

The Breakdown
Public Class Name: In Java, if a class is declared as public, its file name must match the class name exactly, including case.

Your Code: Your code has a public class named HelloApp.

The Error: The error message Class names, 'HelloJava', are only accepted if annotation processing is explicitly requested tells us that you are trying to compile a file named HelloJava.java while the public class inside it is named HelloApp. The compiler sees this mismatch and stops.

How to Fix It
There are two ways to fix this:

Rename your file: The easiest solution is to rename your file from HelloJava.java to HelloApp.java.

Rename your class: Change the name of your public class inside the file from HelloApp to HelloJava.

Once you've made the change, try compiling your code again using javac HelloApp.java (if you renamed the file) or javac HelloJava.java (if you renamed the class).


error: file not found: HelloApp.java

Usage: javac <options> <source files>

use --help for a list of possible options


That error message means the javac compiler couldn't find the file you told it to compile. Here's a quick guide on what that means and how to fix it.

What the Error Means
The command javac HelloApp.java is telling your computer to look for a file named HelloApp.java in your current location (the folder you're in on the command line). The error "file not found: HelloApp.java" simply means that the file isn't in the directory where you're running the command.

How to Fix It
You need to make sure you're in the correct directory before you run the compile command.

Check your current directory:

On Windows, use the command dir.

On macOS or Linux, use the command ls.

This will list all the files and folders in your current location. You should see HelloApp.java in the list.

Navigate to the correct directory:

If the file isn't there, you need to move to the folder where it's saved. You can use the cd (change directory) command to do this.

For example, if your file is in a folder called MyJavaProject on your desktop, you might type:

cd Desktop/MyJavaProject

You can also use the full path to the file. For example:

javac C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\MyJavaProject\HelloApp.java

After you've navigated to the correct folder, run the compile command again: javac HelloApp.java. It should now find the file and compile your code.


This is the output I got

Mode¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†LastWriteTime¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†Length Name

----¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†-------------¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†------ ----

-a----¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 14-08-2025¬† ¬†4:03 PM¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† 941 HelloApp



The output you provided shows that your Windows terminal is truncating the filename. This is a common behavior in some command-line tools when a file has a very long name or includes spaces. The output is showing that a file or directory exists with the name "HelloApp" and its full name is being cut off.

Here's a breakdown of what the output means:

Mode: -a---- indicates that the item is a file (a stands for archive).

LastWriteTime: This is the timestamp of when the file was last modified. In this case, 14-08-2025 4:03 PM.

Length: The size of the file in bytes, which is 941.

Name: This is where the issue is visible. The name is listed as HelloApp, but the full name, which should include the file extension like .java, is not being displayed completely.

The output confirms that a file named HelloApp exists in the directory you are in. It's likely that the full name of your Java source file is HelloApp.java, which is what you need.

Next Steps üöÄ
The original error "file not found: HelloApp.java" happened because the command javac HelloApp.java was not being run in the directory that contained the file. Now that you've confirmed the file is there, you can proceed with the next steps from the original guide.

Compile your code: You are in the right directory. Run the compile command again:

javac HelloApp.java

If successful, this will create a new file named HelloApp.class.

Create the JAR file: After you have the .class file, you can create the JAR file.

jar -cvfe HelloApp.jar HelloApp HelloApp.class

This command will package your compiled code into a runnable HelloApp.jar file.

After successfully creating the JAR file, you can proceed with the AWS CloudFormation steps we discussed previously, starting with uploading your JAR file to an S3 bucket.


error: file not found: HelloApp.java

Usage: javac <options> <source files>

use --help for a list of possible options



Got this error again



You're still getting the "file not found" error, which means the command prompt or terminal cannot locate the HelloApp.java file in the directory you are currently in. The previous dir output was misleading because it showed HelloApp without the .java extension, but it was likely referring to your file.

Let's try a different approach to ensure you're in the right place.

The Problem: Wrong Location üó∫Ô∏è
The javac command only works if the file you're trying to compile is in the same folder where you're running the command. This is the most common reason for this specific error.

How to Fix It: Absolute Path üìù
Instead of navigating to the directory, let's use the full or absolute path to the file in your command. This tells the compiler exactly where to look, no matter where you are in the terminal.

Find the full path to your file:

Windows: Find HelloApp.java in File Explorer. Right-click the file, and click "Properties". In the properties window, you'll find the full path listed next to "Location". You'll need to add the file name to this path. For example, the path might be C:\Users\YourName\Documents\HelloApp.java.

macOS: Find the file in Finder. Right-click the file, and press the Option key. The "Copy 'HelloApp.java' as Pathname" option will appear. Click it to copy the full path.

Use the full path in your command:

Once you have the full path, run your compile command again, but this time, use the full path you just copied.

Windows Example:
javac C:\Users\YourName\Documents\HelloApp.java

macOS Example:
javac /Users/YourName/Documents/HelloApp.java

After running this command, your Java file should compile and create the HelloApp.class file in the same directory. If it still fails, double-check that the file name is spelled correctly and the path is exact.


I have saved the file as all files the HelloApp one


It sounds like when you saved your file, you didn't include the .java extension. When you save a file as "All Files" in an editor, it often doesn't automatically add a file extension. The file name is probably just HelloApp instead of HelloApp.java.

The Java compiler, javac, is very specific. It needs the file to end in .java to know it's a Java source code file it can compile. That's why you're getting the "file not found" error‚Äîit's looking for HelloApp.java, but the file is just named HelloApp.

How to Fix It
The easiest solution is to simply rename the file.

Find the file: Locate your HelloApp file in File Explorer (on Windows) or Finder (on Mac).

Rename the file: Right-click the file and choose "Rename."

Add the extension: Change the name from HelloApp to HelloApp.java.

Confirm the change: Your computer might warn you about changing the file extension. Confirm that you want to do this.

After you've renamed the file, go back to your command line and run the compile command again from the same directory where the file is located:

javac HelloApp.java

This time, the compiler should find the file and create HelloApp.class, allowing you to proceed with creating your JAR file.


After the command javac HelloApp.java and HelloApp.class

I got the follwoing error



HelloApp.class : The term 'HelloApp.class' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program.

Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path is correct and try again.

At line:1 char:1

+ HelloApp.class

+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

¬† ¬† + CategoryInfo¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† : ObjectNotFound: (HelloApp.class:String) [], CommandNotFoundException

¬† ¬† + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException





Suggestion [3,General]: The command HelloApp.class was not found, but does exist in the current location. Windows PowerShell does not load commands from the current location by default. If you trust this command, instead type: ".\HelloApp.class". See "get-help about_Command_Precedence" for more details.



That's not an error from the Java compiler; it's a message from PowerShell, which is the command-line environment you're using. The message is telling you that you can't run a .class file directly like a program.

What the Error Means
You successfully compiled your code with javac HelloApp.java. That command created the HelloApp.class file. You then typed HelloApp.class by itself, which PowerShell interpreted as a command you wanted to execute. Since .class files aren't standalone executable programs, PowerShell didn't know what to do with it and gave you that error.

How to Proceed
The next step is to use the java command to run the compiled code in the .class file. You don't need to specify the file extension (.class) when using the java command.

Run your Java application:

java HelloApp

This command tells the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to load and run the main method from the HelloApp.class file. You should see the output:

Server running on port 8080

Create the JAR file:

The previous step just runs your application directly. To get the .jar file needed for the CloudFormation steps, you still need to use the jar command.

jar -cvfe HelloApp.jar HelloApp HelloApp.class

This command packages your compiled code into a runnable .jar file, which is the final artifact you'll upload to AWS S3.


Server running on port 8080

After this out put, where should I put the following command?

jar -cvfe HelloApp.jar HelloApp HelloApp.class



You can put that command in the same command prompt or terminal window where you ran java HelloApp. It's a separate step, so you can execute it right after you see "Server running on port 8080".

Here's the sequence of commands you should run:

Compile your code: javac HelloApp.java

Verify your code runs: java HelloApp

You'll see "Server running on port 8080". You can press Ctrl+C to stop the server since you're just testing it.

Create the JAR file: jar -cvfe HelloApp.jar HelloApp HelloApp.class

The jar command takes your compiled code (HelloApp.class) and packages it into the HelloApp.jar file, which is what you'll upload to AWS for deployment.


Okay, what's the next step


The next step is to upload your HelloApp.jar file to an AWS S3 bucket. This makes your application package accessible to the EC2 instance that CloudFormation will create.

Step-by-Step Guide to Uploading to S3 üì¶
Open the AWS Management Console: Log in to your AWS account.

Navigate to S3: In the search bar at the top, type "S3" and select the S3 service.

Create a New Bucket:

Click the "Create bucket" button.

Give your bucket a unique name (e.g., my-java-app-deployment-bucket). The name must be globally unique across all of AWS.

Choose the AWS Region that is geographically closest to you.

Leave all other settings as their defaults for now and click "Create bucket".

Upload Your JAR File:

Click on the bucket you just created to open it.

Click the "Upload" button.

Drag and drop your HelloApp.jar file into the upload area or click "Add files" to select it.

Click "Upload" to finish the process.

Once the upload is complete, your HelloApp.jar file is safely stored in a cloud location. You'll need the exact name of your S3 bucket when you create the CloudFormation template, as that's how the EC2 instance will know where to download your application from.


Coolll

So how do we procced next?


Okay, the next big step is creating the CloudFormation template. This template is a blueprint that tells AWS exactly what resources to create and how to set them up to host your Java application.

1. Create the CloudFormation Template File
You'll create a text file, usually named template.yaml. This file defines the EC2 instance, a security group to allow web traffic, and the script that will run on the EC2 instance to download and start your application.

Here's the template you'll use. You'll need to replace your-s3-bucket-name with the name of the S3 bucket where you uploaded your HelloApp.jar file.

YAML

AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  MyEC2Instance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t2.micro # A small, free-tier eligible server
      ImageId: ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0 # A common Amazon Linux 2 AMI
      UserData:
        Fn::Base64:
          !Sub |
            #!/bin/bash
            yum update -y
            yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
            aws s3 cp s3://your-s3-bucket-name/HelloApp.jar /home/ec2-user/HelloApp.jar # Downloads your JAR file
            java -jar /home/ec2-user/HelloApp.jar & # Runs your application in the background
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: MyJavaAppInstance
      SecurityGroups:
        - !Ref MySecurityGroup
  MySecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Enable HTTP access on port 8080
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 8080
          ToPort: 8080
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0 # Allows traffic from any IP address
2. Deploy the CloudFormation Stack
This is where you give your blueprint to AWS and it builds everything for you.

Open the AWS Management Console: Go back to your AWS account.

Navigate to CloudFormation: Search for "CloudFormation" in the search bar.

Create a New Stack:

Click the "Create stack" button.

Choose "With new resources (standard)".

Upload the Template:

On the "Create stack" page, select "Upload a template file".

Click "Choose file" and select the template.yaml file you just created.

Click "Next".

Configure Stack Details:

Give your stack a name, like MyJavaAppStack.

Click "Next" again.

Review and Deploy:

Scroll to the bottom of the review page, check the box acknowledging that AWS might create IAM resources, and click "Create stack".

CloudFormation will now start the deployment process. You can watch the events tab to see the resources being created. This will take a few minutes.

3. Verify Your Application is Running
Once the stack status is CREATE_COMPLETE, your application should be live.

Find Your EC2 Instance: Go to the AWS Management Console, search for "EC2," and select the service.

Get the Public IP: In the list of instances, you'll see one with the name MyJavaAppInstance. Select it and look for its Public IPv4 address in the details panel below.

Access Your App: Open a new browser tab and type the public IP address, followed by the port number :8080.

For example: http://123.45.67.89:8080

You should see the message "Hello from EC2!". This confirms that your CloudFormation template successfully launched an EC2 instance, installed Java, and started your application.
